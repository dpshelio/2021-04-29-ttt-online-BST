### Morning

- Matt: Would this exercise be well suited to a 2x2 format with advantages|challenges for leaner|instructor?

- Rodrigo: Is a black-on-white terminal better (/more inclusive) than white-on-black?
    - David: We will talk a bit about that later ;)

- Matt: Walking across the screen breaks up the lesson a bit and gives some variety so it's potentially quite useful. Also helps with going slower.
    - bjorn: But don't move too much because it can be distracting?
    - phuong: But can't do this online ;-)

- Matt: Don't IDEs reduce cognitive load?  [Integrated Developer Environments]
    - Rodrigo: They could increase extraneous load? With things around the IDE distracting you from the lesson’s content
    - Matt: Syntax highlighting is the main thing I was thinking of. And auto-indenting.
        - James: Syntax highlighting isn't really an IDE feature - it is provided by many tet editors
        - Matt: True, James :) Programming-centric text editors are on a spectrum with IDEs...
    - Evgenij: Initially IDEs tend to distract learner (many elements, unclear features), but later on as learner familiarise themselves with IDES they become tools.
    - Evgenij: First we want the concepts to be clear, then the syntax and later on we move to IDE like RStudio to work in an environmnet that is closer to the usual day-to-day working environmnet.
    - Bjorn: Don't the R workshops use RStudio throughout the workshop? (the one | attended did)
        - Matt: The one I  helped with did, too :)
        - James: I am interested in the answer to that.. from the episodes I couldn't tell whether it should be done in Rstudio or just R. Very few people (as far as I know?) use R not through R studio
            - Jenny: +1
            - Vanessa: +1
        - bjorn: And the R console differs btw Windows and Linux. In linux it's in the terminal, but in Windows it's in an awkward GUI
        - Jenny: In the SC base R lesson, Introduction to RStudio comes as episode 9 which made me wondering how it is concepted.
        Matt: R without RStudio is usually used when automating scripts (e.g. for cluster computing), but for development work I don't know anyone who uses R without RStudio. I've tried other IDEs for R, but they're not as good. R on its own is a bit weird on Windows, as Bjorn said!
        - James: In the scientific analysis one the intro to rstudio is right at the beginning
        - Matt: In R for Social Scientists it's in the Setup ;)



- Rodrigo: And for video conferencing? Any general tips?


- Evgenij: humour is a tricky one
    - Evgenij: some hilarious nerdy jokes are incomprehensible without a deep background for example that is difficult to quickly explain, which may leave learners excluded. I like using an occasional XKCD.com comic : )

- Vanessa: Is there a good online equivalent of stickies? “Raise Hand” in Zoom maybe?
    - Matt: I used gather.town (accessibility caveats discussed yesterday) and had areas where people could stand while working/ finished/seeking help.

- Matt: http://code52.org/carnac/ (show keyboard inputs onscreen; free + open source)

- Rodrigo: When designing a lesson (let's say 20 minutes teaching), is it better to do formative assessments throughout the lesson or at the end?
    - Vanessa: +1 for Rodrigo’s question above

- Vanessa: How would you react during a carpentry workshop if a formative assessment would show that most of the learners did not get the message? Is it then advised to stray from the recommended material or simply go over it slower and with more explanation again?
    - Evgenij: Vanessa, in general we recommend to stick to the materials. if a larger group is confused then it is worth spending more time on that section
    - Vanessa: Thanks!

- Ece: How can you test a new lesson before going to learners?


- Jenny: If stated exercise time is Omin - what does that mean for coding along and formative assesments?

- James: Are the formative assessments not already included in the episode plans? I didn’t think that (in general) we'd want to come up with our own material
    - Evgenij: James, there are some exercises included, but you can use other opportunities to check up on learners
    - James: got you, thanks!
    - Evgenij: e.g. as to raise hand if people agree or type a command and ask what do people think will happen before pressing enter


- Ece: What about intermediate level, should we assume they know some basics or always assume some know nothing and we should explain all details?
    - Matt: That's where the "no learner left behind" bit comes in, I think, Ece.
    - Ece: yes but if they join to an intermediate or advanced level where some requirements mentioned?
    - Vanessa: Overall that's probably where good and clear advertising of the contents of the courses comes in, Ece. Ideally, such a situation would be avoided through clear communication before the workshop start
    - Ece: Thanks guys
    - Evgenij: Overall Carpentries material aim at novice level. But there are some development in the Carpentries incubator which may specify some prerequsites (e.g. having completed Software Carpentry). tab completion is an example of lateral learning, something participant pick up along with the main concepts that is


### Afternoon



- Emmanuelle: sorry, but where do I go to see the community discussion slots?
- Erik: https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions
- Emmanuelle: thank you, Erik!

- James: What is discussed in the ‘community discussions’? Sorry if you already said and I missed that
    - David: James, there's normally not a topic fixed. Normally people discusses how their latest workshop went
        - James: Ok thanks - does someone organising it send out a link to join the meeting typically?
    - David: Some discussions, however, do have a topic - I think once a month there's a “themed discussion” I believe that's all to be found on the Etherpad
    - David: Yes! also the google calendar is a good place - https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com
    - James: great thank you.




- Vanessa: Is there a resource for fun icebreaker exercises especially online?
    - David: There's a list, yes.
    - Matt: Ice breakers are not fun
    - David: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/icebreakers/index.html

- Vanessa: I have some general feedback: I quite liked that we practiced these introductions since this is something I may have overlooked in preparing for the workshop. However, I may suggest to do this exercise towards the beginning of the instructor training as it is equally a way to get to know your fellow learers here :)
    - James: +1 Vanessa
    - Matt: ++
    - Emmanuelle: +1
    - Evgeenij: Good point
    - Jenny: +1
    - Matt: @Vanessa - you could raise that as an issue as part of your checkout process
    - David: +1 from me :)

- Vanessa: Could the carpentries as a whole make a feature request to Zoom to allow for a “sticky notes” feature? Cause it is not impossible to implement virtually from a technical standpoint!?
    - David: the reactions checkmark/x faster/slower should stay that way according zoom documentation... but I think it needs to be enabled by the zoom owner.
    - David: zoom docs about nonverbal feedback https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Non-verbal-feedback-and-reactions-
    - David : > Emoji reactions will disappear after 10 seconds, while raise hand and nonverbal feedback, such as Yes, No, Slow down, and Speed up, will be persistent and must be manually removed by the participant or host.
    - Matt: Don't forget about leaving feedback and the post-workshop survey, please :)
    The reactions with a shaded background persist, the others (emoji) don't.
    - David: yeah, that's why asked them yesterday... Also, I believe it may depends on the version of zoom of the participants. Back in Jan zoom set that all of these reactions were non-persistent, then they change it in March... but I've not managed to get it working. Back in Sept was working fine..

- Jenny: Thanks Vanessa.
