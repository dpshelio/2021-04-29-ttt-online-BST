| Should we be concerned that some of the material appears to be based on TED talks rather than pedagogy supported by robust evidence? |     1 |
| For the teaching demo of an episode, can the introduction to episode be outside the timer?                                           |     1 |
| Accessibility: is there best-practices that should be followed during teaching/live-coding? (contrast, color profile,...)            |     1 |
| format: the Etherpad was not really used enough to warrant its existence? Maybe just give straight the Google Doc link               |     0 |
