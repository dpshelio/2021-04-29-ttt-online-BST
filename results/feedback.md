| Should we be concerned that some of the material appears to be based on TED talks rather than pedagogy supported by robust evidence? |     1 |
| For the teaching demo of an episode, can the introduction to episode be outside the timer?                                           |     1 |
| Accessibility: is there best-practices that should be followed during teaching/live-coding? (contrast, color profile,...)            |     1 |
| format: the Etherpad was not really used enough to warrant its existence? Maybe just give straight the Google Doc link               |     0 |

| Need some exercise that takes into account the timing of the lessons.

| Yeah one of the things on the pre-/post-workshop survey asked if we felt prepared to make a website and I don’t feel like that was directly addressed in the sessions                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     0 |
| I think the practical aspects of the workshop were much more useful for me than the theoretical aspects. I would like to have more practice setting up, getting timings right, understanding practically how to do the workshops (what software, how to set up your computers, how to adapt lessons). I didn’t really understand, for example, how I would use Bloom’s taxonomy. |     0 |

| When Evgenij shared the screen I could use a side-by-side gallery of participants + shared screen focus (and annotation was available). When David used OBS these Zoom tools weren’t available, which worked less well for my setup.                                                                                                                                             |     0 |

# Overall notes by the instructors

- **Google docs**:
    - ❌ in etherpad you get a feeling of how many are contributing with the colours.
    - ✅ Add images (like bloom's taxonomy, ...) there, so it's easier to the
      learners to refer to that.
    - Remember to leave gaps with a set of number of empty list of bullet points
      after each question, so it's easier for the participants to type at
      different places without "eating" others.
- **Google slides**:
    - what if google fails? have a pdf copy downloaded in case.
    - kiosk slides before workshop: put background music so when participants
      connect know their sound is working.
- **zoom**:
    - Ask the carpentries to check whether the non-verbal feedback are correctly set (so they work as post-its)
    - Ask the carpentries to allow chat to be saved.
