### Day 1 - morning

- Matt: There seems to be a tension between 'believes they are the best' and ‘open to feedback’ - worth discussing? Are either hallmarks of competence?
      - Evgenij: good point Matt. We should come back to this in a moment. definitely wrth discussing. often We see Dunning Kruger effect: compenent people think they are experts : >
      - Matt: And imposter effects where experts think they are barely even competent.
      - James: My impression is that competence is independent of those things ^^, and is probably a function of actual ability to do stuff (rather than perceived ability)
      - Evgenij: also some people may be expert in a discipline but at the same time novice at giving and providing feedback. We will mention Imposter Effect in more detail in the afternoon. Here the focus is on 'Mental Models'

- Matt: A driver's knowledge is more procedural than conceptual, no? One can be a competent driver while possessing only novice concepts about how a car works.
      - James: I would have said that an expert driver can have little understanding of how the car works? Just a very good understanding of how to drive. I guess we have to distinguish what we are saying they are competent in (driving vs. understanding car)
              - Evgenij: I agree. That also illustrates the danger of using analogies, often they go only so far and break down under scrutiny. One thing we will come back to is that competemnce in an area and compentence in teaching may actually not be strongly correlated aand bot h require deliberate practice
              - David: good point James, you are right, you could be a 1 driver and have very little ide of how the engine works. My reasoning was more about knows how to start, when and why need to change gears - though may not understand the physics/engineering of that.

- Evgenij: As a side note: the Carpentries model of skill acquisition is a simplified version of the 5-stage model by Dreyfus and Dreyfus
      - Matt: [Though they're not 'stages' in the Piajet Developmental Stages sense.]
      - Evgenij: Concept map is not how learning happens in the brain but we use it as Balls-and-sticks model is used in chemistry to explain molecular bindings

- Vanessa: This was a really hard exercise but interesting! May have been a littler easier to get started with a good example :)
      - James: + 1

- Matt:  The mental models in Refilwe’s example are important because when you get odd resuits you need to know if you've ‘got problems with your data pipeline, measurement equipment, or understanding of the atmospheric systems :)
      - Refilwe: indeed Matt.

- Evgenij: we could call that person "Car User"
      - Matt: Driving a car is procedural knowledge which can be quite difficult to verbalise and teach!
      - Evgenij: and in the past people who owned cars knew much more about how to fix them (but it was also easier as cars were less complex)
      - Matt: It's almost impossible to explain to someone how to ride a bike (or even explain how _you_ ride a bike). [to take a classic example]
      - Evgenij: an example of ongoing specialisation in society

- Bjorn: So it's better to add few connected bubbles rather than adding lots of bubbles and connecting them later? (for novices)
    - Evgenij: yes the whole lesson may have a large associate concept map and wezoom in on a subsection at a time
    - Matt: Novices often have trouble even identifying what things are discrete concepts. What's the difference between a variable and a function? What's the difference between a statement and an expression? Before you have the concepts they are largely indistinguishable.
        - Evggenij: one exercise could be (ater introducing the concepts) give the concept map with predefined concepts and ask people to fill in the relationships between them
            - Matt: That exercise pattern is used extensively by online automated teaching sets (e.g. word completion exercises).


- Matt: It's worth flagging when you sacrifice truth for clarity, I think - it's much harder to correct factual errors that have been taught by further teaching (at least with some students).
    - Evgenij: sometimes even facts change : >
    - Vanessa: In general, I would expect a good teacher to simplify concepts for me (and thereby leave out parts of the truth or ‘bend the truth’ or whatever you want to call it). But I agree, if it's a certain concept that they are intentionally leaving out, it can help to mention that upfront.



- Matt: Daniel Dennett has a good example of a game which simulates geographical effects (soil deposition, erosion, etc) and asks players to create specific end-states by applying different processes. (and argues that students who can successfully complete the game evidence understanding of the concepts involved) That kind of modification on the fly is flexibility which comes with (teaching) expertise!



- Matt: Does that strategy work where the majority opt for the incorrect answer? ['that strategy': showing the distribution of MCQ responses and asking people to explain/convince others of their answer and answer again before revealing the correct answer]
    - James: It would be interesting to ask students about their confidence in their answer (not just their answer), before asking them to discuss
        - Matt: As a metacognition researcher, I endorse this idea ^^
        - Refilwe: Yes James. That is an interesting one.



- Vanessa:  Don't know if we have time to discuss such things, but I'd appreciate knowing which tool(s) you use in such a scenario (getting MCQ responses and distributions in real time)
    - Matt: https://wwww.mentimeter.com is a common one. You might also try e.g. http:/trypingo.com/
    - James: Any reason to prefer that to e.g. polls within zoom? Seems like you have to pay for more than very basic capability
    - Evgenij: Some peopel use socrative too.



- Matt: Jargon is often jargon precisely _because_ it picks out concepts.  E.g. we complain about scientists using fancy words to describe common concepts, but often fail to appreciate that the scientific words have a precise, operationalised meaning, while the common concepts they roughly correspond to are much looser,
    - Dan: True, but there are examples where the jargon is not needed in the context, or is duplicated so different fields have different words for the same thing (looking at you Stats)
    - James: the jargon must (should) have a precise meaning that doesn't involve the use of that jargon.. It seems like in teaching the extra concision from jargon is not worth the possibility for lack of understanding. Although I guess that at some point you will need to be familiar with the jargon
    - Vanessa: It can also help to say that something can just be treated as a jargony abbreviation without the need to currently understand what it stands for rather than leaving people wonder why you constantly say FUFAP
        - Matt: Very true! (both) But part of your role in teaching e.g. undergrads is to allow them to be part of the communicative community around the topic
    - Evgeenij: some exaple from functional programming “a monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X", explaining jargon by more jargon (ot very helpful)
        - Matt: Evgenij's example reads like a R error message or manual entry. Very frustrating for novices.
    - Matt: Expert mathematicians use fluid representations all the time to map problems from geometric spaces to matrices to equations...
    - Vanessa: Reminds me of our English teacher in 8th grade: “A runaway is someone who runs away”



- James: David - how do you superimpose your video in the comer on your slides - are you using OBS for this?
    - Vanessa: +1 for that question!
    - Jennifer: +1
    - Matt: 0BS (Open Broadcaster Software) is great. https://obsproject.com/
        - Evegenij: Yes I think it is OBS.

- James: I'm impressed with whoever got 10!
    - Rodrigo: May not be native in English :)
    - Vanessa: May not be as proficient in typing fast (less time to retrieve)
    - Bjorn: May have a son with sleep regression
    - Evgenij: I think it is Benny Lewis, a US Memory Champion, who gives example of how to memorise stuff on Youtube. One is to create outrageous images in connection with the words you want to remember. I cam across that as part of ["Learning How To Learn* MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
        - Evgenij (I might have mixed pu the name though with the person learning lots of languages ?!)
- Vanessa: It “felt” like a bigger difference (statistics results)
    - James: The paired t-test was significant!

- Mattt: That theory would seem to predict that people with a sensory deprivation (blindness, deafness, anosmia, etc) would learn everything better?
    - Vanessa: Isn't that indeed a common conception of learners with those types of abilities? | am assuming that there may be extra challenges that balance it out?

- Matt: Following someone's suggestion for formative assessment earlier, you could also give a faded example where you provide the code and ask for the DocString stuff.
    - Evegenij: 1 think Learning Styles (once popular) idea now was dismissed by the community. People tend to advocate Multimodal Learning - e..g. Watchign a video and takign notes, then solving programming challenges. Deliberate practice is key (rather than only "practice"). And feeback play a large role.
    - Matt: The Learning Styles as in individual learners having a specific 'style’ has not survived as a theory. The idea that there are
different ways of presenting material, which may be more or less effective for a specific combination of learner, material, and presentation, is fairly well supported.


### Day 2 - afternoon


- James: So it's kind of ‘ability'?
    - Matt: Feeling of achievability/ability to make progress with learning, I think? It'd have to be a neater version :)

- Matt: Can you tell people that they _will_ find it easy eventually?
    - David: With practice ;). We will get into that in a second, about how to “shape" their mindset.
    - Matt: I guess you can point out how it's _easier_ than the alternative (e.g. vector-based operations as compared with loopbased implementations).
        - James: I had exactly that same question ^^. Like using R _is_ easier than excel for lots of things once you know a little bit and for me that seems like a good motivating factor to get people to leamn R
            - David: For an R expert. An Excel expert may not find these steps so easy.
                - James: I didn't write it there so I guess someone else also had it...  But good point David, that seems right
                - Matt: I think for the R/Excel thing I'd probably point to things R does that require either advanced Excel skills (pivot tables) or extremely advanced Excel skills (Visual Basic for Applications).
                - James: Agreed @matt
                - David: The problem with "comparing” x vs y tool is that we have to be really careful to don't compare them in a dismissive way. Have a think about how it can be misunderstood saying this task is easier in x than in y.
                    - Matt: Interesting, David - i'm quite used to a ‘right tool for the job’ mindset (bearing in mind that some jobs are adequately ‘achieved by multiple tools, e.g. Python/R), so I'm not sure what things you have in mind!
                        - Bjorn: Learning R actually helped me make better Excel spreadsheets!
                        - David: when we are telling a researcher that they are not using the right-tool(TM) to, e.g., plot a csv, because they use excel it may make them run away from the workshop... even when they had an interest to learn R.
                            - Matt: David - I'd agree. I think I had in mind more advanced tasks, like subsetting data for analysis, conditional iteration, etc. But I suppose I'd point out that you can make perfectly adequate graphs in Excel (or MATLAB or MatPlotLib) but you can make them easily and iterate on them rapidly in ggplot::
                                 - David: + ggplot (and any tool that implements the grammar of graphics neatly)
                                 - James: {slightly off:topic, but there is a gramamr of graphics implementation for MATLAB - Gramm]
                                     - Matt: I didn't know that, James (long time since I used MATLAB now!). That's really cool.
                             - James: I definitely see where David is coming from and can imagine people being put off if it seems like you are ‘attacking’ their preferred software. At the same time it seems hard to me to justify using something without making some sort of comparison... E.g. coding will end up being faster (than what?), more reproducible (than what?)
                                 - Matt: ++ James
                                 - David: @james, exactly. You need to focus on the good things and explain these without being dismissive. Does it help to create workflows that are more maintainable? Does it help to create reproducible science? Depending on the audience you need to adjust those points so that by these small blocks they can see whether that tool is more appropriate for their task. But simply saying this is “easier" (in general) is dangerous.
                                     - James: that makes sense to me

                - Vanessa: I like to remind myself that - for my applications at least - the outcome is the most important. So as long as the script did what I needed it to do (e. g. produce a plot) then it is less important how perfect the code is (perfectionism vs getting the job done)
                    - Matt: Agreed, Vanessa! Code maintainability and reliability is also important, but functionality comes first.
                        - Vanessa: 1'd love to get better at maintainability, Matt - I like to think that it'd be easier if I worked together with more people who are also coding (that’s why I'm trying to teach people around me, hrhr)
                        - Matt: Good call, Vanessa!
                - Vanessa: In line with that, I also still use Excel, because sometimes it's just fast and I get the answer I need (I don't need to deal with reading in messy data for example)
                    - Matt: Spreadsheets can do excellent things, and they really are wonderful for specific tasks ++

                - Jenny: Tool x vs. y: also consider the time needed to get sth done, especially if it's a one-timer. One tends to use the language one is most familiar with, even if it might not be the optimal choice for the task.
                    - Vanessa: Yes ++ Jenny. I have told myself many times that a certain task is a one time and was surprised later one however, hahaha
                        -  Jenny: @Vanessa Yes, true and even if it is one application, I keep plagiarising myself and often reuse code-bits in different context. What I meant is more that computational efficiency is often not very important in a research context - often it does not matter if it is not the most efficient implementation, as long as the task is executed.




- Vanessa: Are there accessibility resources for online teaching? I am thinking e. g. of automated captioning or things like that?
    - Matt: You can use the Dictate function in MS Word and then edit it afterwards (works quite well, apparently)


- Rodrigo: I have a question about designing for users with anxiety: one point in one of the posters advises to give users enough time to complete an action and not rush them. How do you conciliate this with “harsh” time limits, e.g. in breakout rooms? Is it helpful to reassure users that the limit is not strict, or does that “only make it worse"?
    - Matt: Breakout rooms is a fantastic example where you can critique the design. In part that's imposed by zoom. Using a more organic platform like GatherTown would allow you to organise breakout rooms in a more in-person style where people have some control over when they enter and leave the rooms.
    - Rodrigo: Indeed! But I think this is also a part of just giving a workshop in general. At some point, you have to control time in order to get through the lessons within the expected time frame. You can't really escape from impose a time constraint, I was just wondering how I would do this while being as mindful and inclusive as possible. Probably the best thing is to have the exercises well designed, so that it would be unlikely someone would need much more time than alloted
        - David: @Rodrigo I'd ask the person about what "triggers" that anxiety, is it the time constraints or something else that we can incorporate. It's normally better to ask them than assume what's best for them. If they don't have time to solve the exercises, sometime helps to provide the exercises before hand, so that they can read them in advanced. Or to let them know that the solution will be provided at some point. I'm with @matt regarding gather.town, workadventu.re, etc... however they accessibility features are limited :(
            - Matt: I'm curious how gather.town comes short in accessibility compared to e.g. zoom. I'm not deeply aware of zoom's accessibility capabilities.
                - David: gather town needs some spatial awareness to navigate which it doesn't provide that information through a screenreader, for example. Zoom, teams, Skype,... offer some type of close captioning. Certainly it may still fall short on some a11y (accessibility) features. This is one of the reasons why gather.town hasn't been approved at my university
                    - Matt: Thanks, David - so it's a lack of features that makes Zoom/Teams/ete. more accessible! I guess it wouild need some kind of ping interface - interesting problem.

- Matt: BTW growth mindset stuff is a fairly contested theory with studies showing at most pretty small effects.
    - Vanessa: Interesting point, Matt. I don‘t know really anything about the research, but from my understanding, I could see a “fixed mindset' as inhibiting by being a form of anxious stress that keeps your energy with worries (of not being good enough or similar) rather than with having fun while learning something new
    - Matt: Yeah - it's plausible that it's a loose wrapper for different concepts (like motivation) which are doing real work. One might imagine learners being motivated because "I'm good at this sort of thing" (fixed mindset), or demotivated because "There's too much I need to learn” (growth mindset). My motto for programming is that "A change of error message is progress.”
        - David: I like that motto Matt! ;)

- Jenny: Does one of you have insights which one of the poll/feedback-tools is most inclusive?
    - David: @jenny not in detail. We use socrative or mentimeter... but I've not explored the Ally on these. But there are a couple of tools (listed in the material) that can help you to evaluate to some level these tools. Also new versions of Firefox has a tool under development tools.

- Vanessa: The popiilarity of sites like StackOverflow itself shows how “normal’ making errors (and googiing for answers) is, even for many professional computer scientists


- Matt: “Grit' is another of those concepts that isn't well validated. But perseverance is useful and required where things aren't always easy (and passion makes perseverance easier).
    - James: Isn't grit basically perseverance? I'm not sure what the difference would be but this seems like something that doesn't need to be validated.. Persevering at things must be necessary to make progress on something hard
    - Matt: ‘Grit' was given a specific, and over-sold definition by Duckworth, and hasn't shown up well as a stable character trait (as compared to e.g. the 'big 5' personality dimensions of Openness, Contientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
    - James: I see, make sense. I was thinking of it in terms of how defined on the slide, which seems likely to be useful
        - Matt: Yeah, the problem with psychology concepts is they often make deeply intuitive sense, and so do their alternatives!
            - James: Agreed



- Vanessa: I think during this virtual only time of our lives, it is especially important to offer feedback to your colleagues. I often get asked directly after people log off from a call by the presenter “How did I do?” Normally this would naturally be provided by chatting after a presentation while walking back to your desk or similar. Consider that not everybody may be confident enough to ask for feedback, so consider offering your feedback to presenters :)
    - Matt: ++

- Matt: To some extent the 'final product' of The Carpentries' training is the whole session. The Train-the-Instructor courses they run are very like these courses, which are in turn similar to the workshops we'll eventually run.
